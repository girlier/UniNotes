## What is forensics
- use of **science** and **technology** to investigate and establish **facts** in criminal or civil courts of law
## What is Digital Forensics

- Digital forensics: Preserves, collects, analyses digital evidence.
- Involves recovering data from computers, networks, mobile device and other storage media.
- Common evidence: emails, documents, photos, logs, metadata and other digital traces
- Uses forensically sound methods to maintain evidence integrity for legal use.
- Typical steps include evidence acquisition, identification, extraction, documentation, interpretation and reporting.
- Goals are to support legal/criminal proceedings, information security, or internal investigations of digital incidents.
- Specialized tools and techniques are used for evidence recovery, decryption, data carving, password cracking etc.
- Requires specialised expertise in computer technology, data storage, lawful data access, and evidence handling procedures.
- Related subdisciplines focus on network, mobile device, and multimedia forensics, as well as e-discovery for civil litigation.
- Digital forensics practitioners typically can work for law enforcement, legal, corporate or military entities.

## History of Digital Forensics 

- **1888:** Francis Galton made the first-ever recorded study of fingerprints 
- **1893:** Hans Gross was the first person to apply science to a criminal investigation.
- **1910:** Albert Osborn became the first person to develop the essential features of documenting evidence during the examination process
- **1932:** The FBI set up a laboratory to provide forensics services to all field agents and other law authorities 
- **1970s:** Electronic crimes were increasing, especially in the financial sector. Most law enforcement officers didn’t know enough about computers to ask the right questions or how to  preserve the evidence trial.
- **1980s:** PCs gained popularity and different OS emerged. Disk Operating System (DOS) was available. Forensics tools were simple, and most were generated by government agencies.  
- **Mid – 1980s**: Xtree Gold appeared on the market able to recognise file types and retrieve lost or deleted files. Norton DiskEdit soon followed and became the best tool for finding deleted files.
- **1984:** Scotland yard: Computer Crime Unit & FBI Computer Forensic departments.
- **Early 1990s:** Tools, training and associations for computer forensics were becoming available:
	- International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)
	- Training on software for forensic investigations
	- IRS created search-warrant programs
	- Expert Witness for the Macintosh
	- First commercial GUI software for computer forensics created by ASR Data. This recovered deleted files and fragments of  deleted files
	- 1990: Computer Misuse Act (CMA)

## The need for digital forensics 

- Ensures the overall integrity and continued existence of computer systems and network infrastructure in organisations
- Helps the organisations capture important data if their computer systems are compromised.
- Extracts, processes, and interprets the actual evidence in order to prove the offence of the attacker.
- Efficiently tracks down Cyber Criminals, Normal criminals and terrorists.
- Tracks complicated cases such as money laundering and CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)

- Anything that stores or transmits data in a binary form could be digital evidence 
There's a lot of it in our homes now.
