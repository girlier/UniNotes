#Lecture #week2 #DigitalForensics

## Digital Forensics Methodologies
- **Identifications:** the location of evidence and the appropriate tools
- **Preservation:** the original evidence should not be modified or damaged
- **Extraction:** obtaining the evidence
- **Interpretation:** analysis and inspection of the evidence 
- **Presentation:** Record all the steps taken in the investigation in a way that the steps can be traced back (Chain of Custody)

## Assurance of the Digital Forensic Expert
- **Preservation of evidence:** no possible evidence is damaged, destroyed, or compromised by the forensics procedures used to investigate the computer
- **Preservation of contamination of evidence:** No possible computer malware is introduced to the computer being investigated during the analysis process 
- **Extraction and Preservation of evidence:** Any extracted and possibly relevant evidence is properly handled and protected from damage 
- **Accountability of the evidence:** A complete documentation of the investigation procedure 
- **Low interference with organisation:** Ensuring minimum interference with the normal life of the organisation 
- **Ethics of investigation:** Details of the client-attorney relationship are not disclosed in order to maintain professional ethics and legality 

## Locards Exchange Principle

“Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he  leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness  against him.….. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence  
cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly  absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand  it, can diminish its value”

## Investigation principles and strategies 

- evidence investigation can be labour intensive
- electronic evidence is volatile and may be easily changed
- electronic evidence conversely is difficult to delete entirely 
- association of chief police officers (ACPO) suggested a good practice guide (ACPO guideline)
- four principles of computer based electronic evidence
- insure that all forensics investigators use the same framework/standard

**ACPO Guideline**

- **Principle 1:** no action taken by law enforcement agencies or their agents should change data held on a computer or storage media which may subsequently be relied upon in court

- **Principle 2:** in exceptional circumstances, where a person finds it necessary to access original data held on a computer or storage media, that person must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of their actions. 

##### **Chain of custody**

The chain of custody means keeping a complete log, including:
- time
- data
- taken actions
- reasons
of the steps taken in the investigation from the beginning (i.e. seizure of the digital equipment) to the presentation phase in a way that one can follow the steps and obtains the same results 

**Documentation includes:**
- Case number
- name
- title 
- address
- telephone number of the initial person to take the evidence
- where the evidence was received from 
- location 
- reason for the evidence being obtained 
- item number
- quantity
- description including unique markings
- colour and any packaging information

## The Rules of evidence

1. **Admissible**
2. **Authentic**
3. **Complete**
4. **Reliable**
5. **Believable**

## Expert Witness

- someone who is a qualified specialist who testifies in court
- expert testimony is an exception to the rule against giving opinions in court.
